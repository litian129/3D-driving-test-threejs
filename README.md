# ThreeBoilerplate

This is the boilerplate that I'm using for my Three.js tutorials.

Wanna use it? okay then just follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository;
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code;
3. Open the terminal and type this command: npm install
4. Run the app on the server by typing this command: npx parcel ./src/index.html
5. Ctrl + click on the server link "http://localhost:1234" to open the app in your browser;
6. Have fun!

• The ./static folder is where you put the images and 3D models.

• The the ./src/ is where you put your Javascript and CSS folders and files.
